# Invoking services

OSCAR services can be invoked synchronously and asynchronously sending an
HTTP POST request to paths `/run/<SERVICE_NAME>` and `/job/<SERVICE_NAME>`
respectively. For file processing, OSCAR automatically manages the creation
and [notification system](https://docs.min.io/minio/baremetal/monitoring/bucket-notifications/bucket-notifications.html#minio-bucket-notifications)
of MinIO buckets in order to allow the event-driven invocation of services
using asynchronous requests, generating a Kubernetes job for every file
to be processed.

## Service access tokens

As detailed in the [API specification](api.md), invocation paths require the
service access token in the request header for authentication. Service access
tokens are auto-generated in service creation and update, and MinIO eventing
system is automatically configured to use them for event-driven file
processing. Tokens can be obtained through the API, using the
[`oscar-cli service get`](oscar-cli.md#get) command or directly from the web
interface.

## Synchronous invocations

Synchronous invocations allow obtaining the execution output as the response
to the HTTP call to the `/run/<SERVICE_NAME>` path. For this, OSCAR delegates
the execution to a Serverless Backend ([Knative](https://knative.dev) or
[OpenFaaS](https://www.openfaas.com/)). Unlike asynchronous invocations, that
are translated into Kubernetes jobs, synchronous invocations use a "function"
pod to handle requests. This is possible thanks to the
[OpenFaaS Watchdog](https://github.com/openfaas/classic-watchdog), which is
injected into each service and is in charge of forking the process to be
executed for each request received.

Synchronous invocations can be made through OSCAR-CLI, using the comand `oscar-cli service run`:

```sh
oscar-cli service run [SERVICE_NAME] {--input | --text-input} {-o | -output }
```

You can check these use-cases:

- [plant-classification-sync](https://oscar.grycap.net/blog/post-oscar-faas-sync-ml-inference/)
- [text-to-speech](https://oscar.grycap.net/blog/post-oscar-text-to-speech/).

The input can be sent as a file via the `--input` flag, and the result of the execution will be displayed directly in the terminal:

```sh
oscar-cli service run plant-classification-sync --input images/image3.jpg
```

Alternatively, it can be sent as plain text using the `--text-input` flag and the result stored in a file using the `--output` flag:

```sh
oscar-cli service run text-to-speech --text-input "Hello everyone"  --output output.mp3
```

### Input/Output

[FaaS Supervisor](https://github.com/grycap/faas-supervisor), the component
in charge of managing the input and output of services, allows JSON or base64
encoded body in service requests. The body of these requests will be
automatically decoded into the invocation's input file available from the
script through the `$INPUT_FILE_PATH` environment variable.

The output of synchronous invocations will depend on the application itself:

1. If the script generates a file inside the output dir available through the
`$TMP_OUTPUT_DIR` environment variable, the result will be the file encoded in
base64.
2. If the script generates more than one file inside `$TMP_OUTPUT_DIR`, the
result will be a zip archive containing all files encoded in base64.
3. If there are no files in `$TMP_OUTPUT_DIR`, FaaS Supervisor will return its
logs, including the stdout of the user script run.
**To avoid FaaS Supervisor's logs, you must set the service's `log_level` to `CRITICAL`.**

This way users can adapt OSCAR's services to their own needs.

### OSCAR-CLI

OSCAR-CLI simplifies the execution of services synchronously via the
[`oscar-cli service run`](oscar-cli.md#run) command. This command requires
the input to be passed as text through the `--text-input` flag or directly a
file to be sent by passing its path through the `--input` flag. Both input
types are automatically encoded in base64.

It also allow setting the `--output` flag to indicate a path for storing (and
decoding if needed) the output body in a file, otherwise the output will be
shown in stdout.

An illustration of triggering a service synchronously through OSCAR-CLI can
be found in the [cowsay example](https://github.com/grycap/oscar/tree/master/examples/cowsay#oscar-cli).

### cURL

Naturally, OSCAR services can also be invoked via traditional HTTP clients
such as [cURL](https://curl.se/) via the path `/run/<SERVICE_NAME>`. However,
you must take care to properly format the input to one of the two supported
formats (JSON or base64 encoded) and include the
[service access token](#service-access-tokens) in the request.

An illustration of triggering a service synchronously through cURL can be
found in the [cowsay example](https://github.com/grycap/oscar/tree/master/examples/cowsay#curl).

To send an input file through cURL, you must encode it in base64. To avoid
issues with the output in synchronous invocations remember to put the
`log_level` as `CRITICAL`. Output, which is encoded in base64, should be
decoded as well. Save output in the expected format of the use-case.

``` sh
base64 input.png | curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" -d @- https://<CLUSTER_ENDPOINT>/run/<OSCAR_SERVICE> | base64 -d > result.png
```

### Limitations

Using synchronous invocations couldn't be the best way to run long-running
resource-demanding applications, like deep learning inference or video
processing. This is due to the fact that Kubernetes Serverless Backends do not
handle elasticity in the same way as their counterparts in public clouds, such
as AWS Lambda. When multiple requests come to OpenFaaS, the function pod
itself, with its resource specification (i.e. memory and CPU limits and
requests), tries to process them simultaneously, which can cause an overload.
Therefore, we consider Kubernetes job generation as the optimal approach to
handle event-driven file processing through asynchronous invocations in OSCAR,
being the execution of synchronous services a convenient way to support
general lightweight container-based applications.

Otherwise, OSCAR allows the configuration of the OpenFaaS Watchdog to limit
the number of events to be processed by a function pod simultaneously. This
can be done through the `max_inflight` option of the watchdog, which can be
configured globally in the OSCAR deployment through the
`WATCHDOG_MAX_INFLIGHT` environment variable and the
[helm chart parameter](https://github.com/grycap/helm-charts/tree/master/oscar)
`openfaas.watchdog.maxInflight`.
