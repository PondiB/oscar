# Fire detection

This example is extracted from the Github repository [efficient-compact-fire-detection-cnn](https://github.com/NeelBhowmik/efficient-compact-fire-detection-cnn), which implements a real-time fire detection based on convolutional neural networks.

The inference file has been modified so the output can be an image of the superpixel fire prediction and a textfile with only the prediction as text (FIRE/NO_FIRE).
In addition, you can enable the SNS option, in order to send an sns notification via aws-cli if fire is detected, by setting the enviroment variable $SEND_SNS to true and adding the following aws-cli configuration variables.

```
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: [aws_access_key_id]
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: [aws_secret_access_key]
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: [aws_default_region]
    AWS_DEFAULT_OUTPUT: json
    TOPIC_ARN: [topic_arn]
```

The image for the service has been build an pushed to a public github registry but you can see the Dockerfile that generates it [here](Dockerfile).

Because this example is an asynchronous one, once you have the function deployed into an OSCAR cluster, you can upload to the specified input bucket the image that you want to process, through oscar-ui or whichever storage provider that you are using.

As mentioned, the output would be an image and a textfile like the ones shown next, zipped within the corresponding input image.

Here is an example of a prediction output:

## Example with replicas

In addition, this example has another function definition file (`fire_detection_replicas.yaml`) which uses the ReScheduler and Resource Manager features, where the main cluster can delegate jobs to another when it is overloaded. As you can see, the file includes two definitions of the function, one for each cluster, and the `replicas` field in the cluster `oscar-cluster-edge`, referencing the service in the `oscar-cluster` as a replica to delegate jobs.

*This feature is introduced in OSCAR v2.5.0 and oscar-cli v1.3.0. Remember to set the environment variables `RESOURCE_MANAGER_ENABLE` and `RESCHEDULER_ENABLE` to `true` to enable it.*
