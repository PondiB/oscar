# OSCAR Examples

This folder includes different use cases of applications that use the OSCAR framework for event-driven high-throughput processing of files:

* [Plants Classification](https://github.com/indigo-dc/plant-classification-theano), an application that performs plant classification using Lasagne/Theano.
* [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org), a tool to manipulate images.
* [Radiomics](https://github.com/eubr-atmosphere/radiomics), a use case about the handling of Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) through image computing and Artificial Intelligence (AI).
* Mask detector workflow, which employs [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [Blurry Faces](https://github.com/asmaamirkhan/BlurryFaces) to extract frames out of an input video and anonymise them before being processed by the [Mask detector](https://github.com/adityap27/face-mask-detector).
* Video processing workflow, which uses [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) to extract keyframes of the input video and apply the [YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/) inference model to recognise objects.
* [Cowsay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowsay), a simple toy application to show the operation of [OSCAR's synchronous invocations](https://docs.oscar.grycap.net/invoking/#synchronous-invocations).
